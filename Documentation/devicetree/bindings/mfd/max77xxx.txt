Maxim MAX77XXX multi-function device

MAX77XXX is a Mulitifunction device with PMIC, RTC and Charger on chip. It is
interfaced to host controller using i2c interface. PMIC and Charger submodules
are addressed using same i2c slave address whereas the RTC submodule can use
a different i2c slave address (this feature is used for MAX77686).

This document describes the binding for mfd device and PMIC submodule.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "maxim,max77686" or "maxim,max77802"
- reg : Specifies the i2c slave address of PMIC block.
- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC.
- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

Optional node:
- voltage-regulators : The regulators of max77686 have to be instantiated
  under subnode named "voltage-regulators" using the following format.

	regulator_name {
		standard regulator constraints....
	};
	refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

Required properties for each regulator:
- regulator-op-mode : Regulator operating mode, the meaning is regulator-
     dependent. Valid values are 0-3.

  The regulator_name should be initialized with a string which matches
  the hardware counterparts as follow:

	-LDOn	:	for LDOs, where n can lie in range 1 to 26 (1 to 35
			for MAX77802).
			example: LDO1, LDO2, LDO26.
	-BUCKn	:	for BUCKs, where n can lie in range 1 to 9 (1 TO 10
			FOR max77802)
			example: BUCK1, BUCK5, BUCK9.
	EN32KHZ_AP, EN32KHZ_CP	: fake regulators which actually produce
			32KHx clocks
	P32KHZ	:	MAX77686 only: another 32KHz clock

Optional subnode (to enable the RTC):
 - rtc : Indicates that the PMIC includes a real-time-clock. For MAX77686
	the reg property indicates the i2c slave address to use for talking
	to this. For MAX77802 the reg property is not needed and should not
	be specified.


Example:

	max77686@9 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77686";
		interrupt-parent = <&wakeup_eint>;
		interrupts = <26 0>;
		reg = <0x09>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		voltage-regulators {
			LDO11 {
				regulator-name = "vdd_ldo11";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1900000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1900000>;
				regulator-always-on;
				regulator-op-mode = <3>;
			};

			BUCK1 {
				regulator-name = "vdd_mif";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <950000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1300000>;
				regulator-always-on;
				regulator-boot-on;
				regulator-op-mode = <3>;
			};

			EN32KHZ_CP {
				regulator-name = "en32khz_cp";
				regulator-always-on;
				regulator-op-mode = <1>;
			};

		rtc@c {
			reg = <0xc>;
		};
	}
